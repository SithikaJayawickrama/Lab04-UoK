## Lab 04 – Inheritance, Encapsulation, Static, Final and Abstract

### Case Study
A simple **Campus Staff Payment System** that manages two staff types — `Lecturer` and `LabAssistant` — built step by step across 6 questions.

### File Structure

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `StaffMember.java` | Abstract parent class with common fields and static counter |
| `Lecturer.java` | Child class — payment based on courses taught |
| `LabAssistant.java` | Child class — payment based on hours worked |
| `UniversityPolicy.java` | Final class holding university-wide constants and bonus logic |
| `Lab04Main.java` | Main runnable program covering Questions 2 to 6 |

### Concepts Covered
- `abstract` class and method
- `private`, `protected`, `public`, and `final` access control
- `static` fields and methods
- Inheritance using `extends` and `super(...)`
- Encapsulation with controlled updates
- A `final` class that cannot be inherited

### How to Run

```bash
javac *.java
java Lab04Main
```
